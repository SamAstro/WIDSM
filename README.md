## Synopsis

This is my Jupyter notebook reproducing the [WISDM: WIreless Sensor Data Mining]
(http://www.cis.fordham.edu/wisdm/index.php) data analysis, described in the
paper *Jennifer R. Kwapisz, Gary M. Weiss and Samuel A. Moore (2010). Activity
Recognition using Cell Phone Accelerometers, Proceedings of the Fourth
International Workshop on Knowledge Discovery from Sensor Data (at KDD-10),
Washington DC*, found
[here](http://www.cis.fordham.edu/wisdm/includes/files/sensorKDD-2010.pdf). It runs with a
Python 3.x kernel.

## Prerequisites
You need:

* Jupyter  
* Python 3.x  
* the paper data [here](http://www.cis.fordham.edu/wisdm/dataset.php)  
* A couple of Python lib :  
    * Numpy  
    * Sklear  

## Running

To run the notebook, you need Jupyter installed with a Python 3.x kernel. Then
just run 
```
> jupyter-notebook-3.x reproducing_wisdm_data.ipynb
```
in the correct directory.

## Motivation

This notebook is intended as a tutorial.
